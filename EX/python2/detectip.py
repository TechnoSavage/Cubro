""" Use with firmware version 2.2.5 or later. Cubro Packetmaster
REST API demo. Use a Packetmaster 'A' to detect the presence of traffic from
a specified IP address and, upon detection, create a rule on Packetmater 'B'
to block all traffic from that IP address. Prerequisites are that Packetmaster
'A' must have a higher priority rule filtering on the IP address in question.
User should edit the 'execute' function in this script as desired for his
rule parameters. """
