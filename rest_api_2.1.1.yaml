  title: EXWui REST API Documentation
  description: "Description of the public REST API interfaces of the Cubro Packetmaster\
    \ devices.\n### Some notes:\n#### Dynamic Parameters\nIn this document, parameters/Keys\
    \ written in all-caps and in parentheses (e.g. '(EXAMPLE)') are placeholders for\
    \ keys with dynamic names. Three dots after it '...' additionally indicate that\
    \ multiple such fields are expected.\n#### Parameter Casing\nMost parameters are\
    \ in snake case (e.g. \"snake_case\") but some can also be addressed using camel\
    \ case (camelCase) or lower case (lowercase).\n#### JSON parameter format\nAll\
    \ function using the default HTTP parameter format also support JSON as an input\
    \ format format if the content type of the request is \"application/json\".\n\
    `x=1` is equivalent to `{\"x\":1}`, `x[]=1&x[]=2` to `{\"x\":[1,2]}`, and `x[a]=1`\
    \ to `{\"x\":{\"a\":1}}`.\n#### Authentication and Access Checks\nIf UAC (user\
    \ authentication and access control) is activated the REST interface can only\
    \ be used if authenticated through an existing web UI user account. Authentication\
    \ is possible through either HTTP basic authentication or by setting the parameters\
    \ 'username' and 'password'. Note that the console and web/REST users are totally\
    \ seperate. The default web/REST user account has the username 'admin' and password\
    \ 'cubro' (both without quotes).\n\nAn user account has a certain access level\
    \ and REST methods might have minimum level required. Three user level exist:\
    \ READ (1), WRITE (7) and SUPER (31); in the brackets are the numeric representations.\
    \ Every level encompasses the levels below it. A user is at least level 1 (READ).\n\
    #### Types\nSometimes, multiple types are possible for a parameter or returned\
    \ in a response, the type mentioned here always represents the most likely type\
    \ used, e.g. a numeric value for throughputs even if it can be 'n/a' in case the\
    \ port does yet not exist for long enough.\n#### Errors\nErrors are normally returned\
    \ using an error object with an 'error' field but in some cases it is possible\
    \ that it is actually simply in the 'result' field of an result object. This is\
    \ normally only the case if the error is not likely to be dire for the user.\n\
    #### HTTP Methods\nInstead of using the HTTP methods PUT/DELETE there is the possibility\
    \ of using POST together with the HTTP header `X-HTTP-Method-Override:<METHOD>`\
    \ (where `<METHOD>` stands for the PUT/DELETE to represent) instead."
